= Starknet developer tools

Cairo is a turing complete language for writing provable programs. It is also the language used for writing smart contracts for Starknet. Starknet uses a different model than the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and as such, requires specialized tools for development.

Starkli is a fast command-line interface for interacting with the Starknet network. It supports fetching data from the Starknet network, deploying accounts, and interacting with contracts. Developed by https://x.com/cartridge_gg[Jonathan Lei].
Starkli also includes useful utilities for developers, such as:

* Compute class hashes from the Cairo file that defines the class.
* Compute a function’s selector.
* Encode messages.
* Deploying new accounts or fetching existing accounts

[#sdks]
== Starknet SDKs

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a library that abstracts the complexities of Starknet when building transactions and interacting with the blockchain, including the following:

* Read the chain state.
* Account creation and management.
* Cryptography: signature verification and signing, computing hashes used by Starknet.
* Contract declaration and deployment.
* Contract interactions: ABI import, constructing transactions.

SDKs implement the Starknet link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs[JSON RPC specification], and are updated to support the latest API changes. There are SDKs for various languages, so you can choose the SDK according to your needs.

The following tools are the recommended tools for developing Starknet smart contracts. These cover compilation, package management, testing and deployment. 



[#scarb]
=== Scarb: The Cairo package manager

Scarb is a package manager for Cairo, but it is much more than that. It is the easiest and recommended way to build and maintain Cairo code. Think Cargo for Rust.
Scarb is developed by Software Mansion.

Scarb includes the following features:

* Initiating a new Cairo project.
* Compiling Cairo projects.
* Adding and removing Cairo dependencies.
* Generating Cairo documentation.
* Fetching and uploading packages link:https://scarbs.xyz/[Scarbs.xyz], the Cairo Registry.
* Integration with the Cairo Language Server
* It integrates with other tools in the Cairo ecosystem, such as Starknet Foundry and the Dojo gaming engine.

[#starknet_foundry]
=== Starknet Foundry

Starknet Foundry is the go-to toolchain for developing Starknet smart contracts. Similarly to its EVM counterpart, Starknet Foundry supports a plethora of features focused on testing Cairo smart contracts for Starknet.

Starknet Forge, and `snforge_std` allow the use of "cheatcodes" to test various aspects of the contracts.

For example:

* Setting caller address
* Manipulating the timestamp and block number
* Forking the chain at a specific block and testing with that state
* Fuzz testing
* Getting accurate gas and resource reports
* Profiling

Starknet Cast is a command line tool for interacting with the Starknet network, with deep integration with Starknet Foundry projects.
With `sncast` it is possible to:

* Declare and deploy contracts
* Read from Starknet contracts
* Deploy accounts
* Interact with contracts

[#starknet_remix_plugin]
=== The Starknet Remix plugin

Remix is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Ethereum that you can use for learning, experimenting and finding vulnerabilities in smart contracts, without installing anything. The Starknet Remix plugin lets you use Remix for testing Starknet smart contracts, so you can focus on learning Cairo and Starknet in the comfort of your browser.

Remix and the Starknet Remix plugin include the following features:

* Integrated compiling.
* You can deploy contracts to testnet, mainnet and the plugin’s own integrated devnet.
* You can call functions of contracts that you have already deployed, to facilitate testing and interaction.
* The Starknet Remix Plugin is integrated with link:https://starknet-by-example.voyager.online/[Starknet By Example], a rich repository of practical learning content.

[#utilities]
== Utilities

While not under any specific category, these tools can be helpful in various stages of development.

[#usc]
=== Universal Sierra Compiler
While Scarb compiles full projects, and produces both Sierra and CASM files, it is often needed to only compile a single Sierra file to CASM (for example, when getting a class from Starknet mainnet). The Universal Sierra Compiler supports all sierra versions, and can compile the the a CASM file.

[NOTE]
====
The USC comes bundled with Starknet Foundry and does not need to be installed separately if Starknet Foundry is installed.
