= Starknet developer tools

While Starknet is a blockchain, it is different from blockchains built on the model of the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), and so it requires many of its own developer tools. The tools discussed here are being developed in coordination with StarkWare and, in some cases, have received grants from StarkWare or the Starknet Foundation to make the development process as friendly as possible, with improvements happening constantly.

While the stack of Starknet development tools was originally based mostly on Python, tool developers are moving towards building with Rust.

See xref:#tools_per_stage_of_development[] below to understand where each tool fits in the development process.

[NOTE]
====
This list of tools is dynamic and is being updated as more tools are added. If a tool you are using is missing, please consider editing this page and creating a Pull Request.

== Command-line tools

[#starkli]
=== starkli

Starkli is a fast command-line interface for interacting with the Starknet network. It supports fetching data from the Starknet network, deploying accounts, and interacting with contracts. Developed by Jonathan Lei.
Starkli also includes useful utilities for developers, such as:

* Compute class hashes from the Cairo file that defines the class.
* Compute a function’s selector.
* Encode messages.
* Fetching existing accounts
* The ability to make multi-calls.

[#sdks]
== Starknet SDKs

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a library that abstracts the complexities of Starknet when building transactions and interacting with the blockchain, including the following:

* Read the chain state.
* Account creation and management.
* Cryptography: Signature verification and signing, computing hashes used by Starknet.
* Contract interactions: ABI import, constructing transactions.

There are several SDKs for various languages, so you can choose the SDK according to your preferred language.

[#Contract-Development]
== Smart Contract Development
Cairo is a turing complete language for writing provable programs. It is also the language used for writing smart contracts for Starknet. Developing Cairo is supported by the following tools.

[#scarb]
=== Scarb: The Cairo package manager

Scarb is a package manager for Cairo, but it is much more than that. It is the easiest and recommended way to build and maintain Cairo code. Think Cargo for Rust.
Scarb is developed by Software Mansion.

Scarb includes the following features:

* Initiating a new Cairo project.
* Compiling Cairo projects.
* Adding and removing Cairo dependencies.
* Generating Cairo documentation.
* Fetching and uploading packages to the Cairo registry
* Integration with the Cairo Language Server
* It integrates with other tools in the Cairo ecosystem, such as Starknet Foundry and the Dojo gaming engine.

[#starknet_foundry]
=== Starknet Foundry

Starknet Foundry is the go-to toolchain for developing Starknet smart contracts. Similarly to its EVM counterpart, Starknet Foundry supports a plethora of features focused on testing Cairo smart contracts for Starknet.

Starknet Forge, and `forge_std` allow the use of "cheatcodes" to test various aspects of the contracts.
For example:
* Setting caller address
* Manipulating the timestamp and block number
* Forking the chain at a specific block and testing with that state
* Fuzz testing
* Getting accurate gas and resource reports
* Profiling

Starknet Cast is a command line tool for interacting with the Starknet network, with deep integration with Starknet Foundry projects.
With `sncast` it is possible to:
* Declare and deploy contracts
* Read from Starknet contracts
* Deploy accounts
* Interact with contracts

[#starknet_remix_plugin]
=== The Starknet Remix plugin

Remix is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Ethereum that you can use for learning, experimenting and finding vulnerabilities in smart contracts, without installing anything. The Starknet Remix plugin lets you use Remix for testing Starknet smart contracts, so you can focus on learning Cairo and Starknet in the comfort of your browser.

Remix and the Starknet Remix plugin include the following features:

* Integrated compiling.
* You can deploy contracts to testnet, mainnet and the plugin’s own integrated devnet.
* You can call functions of contracts that you have already deployed, to facilitate testing and interaction.
* The Starknet Remix Plugin is integrated with link:https://starknet-by-example.voyager.online/[Starknet By Example], a rich repository of practical learning content.

[#devnets]
== Local Development nodes
A Starknet devnet is a local node Starknet node implementations, aimed for testing and development. A devnet behaves just like a real Starknet node, but everything is executed locally. This enables much faster and more private development of Starknet applications.


[#starknet-devnet-rs]
=== starknet-devnet-rs

starknet-devnet-rs can is a Rust implementation of a local Starknet node. Developed by SpaceShard.

With starknet-devnet-rs includes many featured tailored for testing and development, which are not present on testnet/mainnet.
Some of the features include:

* Pre-deployed and pre-funded accounts
* Forking the chain at a specific block.
* Dumping current state (and loading in future runs)
* Impersonating account
* Mock L1<>L2 communication
